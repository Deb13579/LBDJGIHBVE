        <h2>My games!</h2>
        <p>I have used many libraries like p5.js and p5.play.js, which were essential
           in<br> making games like the Trex game, car racing game, and my recent driving
           test game
        </p>

        <p>The first game I built was a pong game. 2 characters face each other off in a 1v1 pong match<br>
        The first one who reaches 5 points wins the game. I used Code.org to build this game</p>

        <p>This game I made was a game in my early days of coding, which is the popular Trex game<br>
        Using P5 editor, I was able to make the game by using functions and modulus function</p>

        <p>The car racing game was one of the hardest games. We learnt about using Firebase database<br>
        and we also used different classes, such as Form.js. We used Visual Studio code to make this</p>

        <p>This was my last game using Java(for the time being) and it was the hardest game yet.<br> 
        Making the game resulted in lots of bugs, but after over 4 hours of work, I made my own game!</p>
